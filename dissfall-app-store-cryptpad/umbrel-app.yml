description: >
  CryptPad is a collaboration suite that is end-to-end encrypted and open-source.
  It is designed to facilitate collaboration by synchronizing changes to documents in real time.
  Since all the user data is encrypted, in the event of a breach, attackers have no way of accessing the stored content.
  Furthermore, if the administrators do not modify the code, they and the service also cannot access any information about the users' content.
